Online Integrated Concept Solutions (OICS) is committed to respecting your privacy. This statement applies with respect to (i) personal data we collect (i) 
from <strong>http://www.oicsgroupng.com/</strong> and any other sites on the World Wide Web owned and/or operated by Online Integrated Concept Solutions 
("Online Integrated Concept Solutions Websites") (ii) at events hosted or attended by Online Integrated Concept Solutions (iii) via direct marketing campaigns 
conducted by telephone or email or (iv) in the course of other similar marketing activities. This statement is part of the Terms of Use 
of our website and is subject to all of its terms. Below is information regarding the commitment of Online Integrated Concept Solutions to protect 
the personal data of individuals.
						</p>
						<p>
						   
The term "personal data" includes any information that enables you to be identified, such as your name, physical address, e-mail address 
and/or phone number.
	<h3>1. Nature of the Data Collected and Purpose of the Data Processing</h3>
Collection – Websites - When you access the OICS Websites, OICS collects the IP address of the 
computer you are using to browse the site. If this address is a "static" or fixed IP address, OICS could in certain 
circumstances theoretically be able to identify you, and therefore, this type of information could be considered personal data. However, 
OICS only collects this type of information to compile usage statistics on an anonymous basis; OICS 
does not collect IP address data to identify you.
Apart from your IP address, no personal data is transmitted when accessing OICS Websites. Unless you submit personal 
data about yourself voluntarily by filling in a form or by sending us an e-mail, we will not maintain any other personal data as a result 
of your access and usage of the OICS Websites.
If you have requested information from OICS through an online or paper form or over the phone, we use the information 
you submit to register you to receive customized marketing information by phone, post, on-line download or e-mail. You may request to 
cease receiving such information at any time following registration. You may request to be removed from our register by sending an email 
to <strong>info@oicsgroupng.com</strong> with the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the email subject line or by following the unsubscribe 
instructions at the bottom of the email. You may request to be removed from our postal mailing list by sending an e-mail message to 
<strong>info@oicsgroupng.com</strong> or by sending a letter to:<br>
Online Integrated Concept Solutions<br>
Attn: Privacy<br>
23A Adenike Ogunye,<br>
Magodo, Ikeja<br>
Lagos, Nigeria<br>
If you subsequently request additional information from Online Integrated Concept Solutions, we will consider such contact a request to re-subscribe 
and will re-register you to receive customized marketing information by phone, post, on-line download or e-mail.
Online Integrated Concept Solutions Websites may also require you to register to enjoy certain services provided through the site, such as on-line 
support or on-line education. The information provided in the context of registering for these services is collected to respond to your 
inquiry, process an order, to provide you with access to specific account information or to enable us to provide you the aforementioned 
on-line services securely through password protection.
In addition, in order to better understand the needs of the visitors to the Online Integrated Concept Solutions Websites and to adapt the Online Integrated Concept Solutions Websites to these needs, we occasionally conduct on-line surveys. Participation in these surveys is optional. The data 
collected through these surveys is used for statistical analysis of visitor, Online Integrated Concept Solutions product or product category 
assessments and for direct marketing purposes.

<p><h3>5. Security of Your Data </h3>
Online Integrated Concept Solutions takes all commercially reasonable precautions to adequately prevent others from freely accessing the information
